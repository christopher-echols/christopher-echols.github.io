                <h2>A linocut Christmas gift for my mom and aunt.</h2>
            </section>
            <p>One Christmas, when I was fifteen or so, my aunt asked if I would <em>make</em> her something instead of buying her a present. So I did. The next year, she asked again.</p>
            <p>It's been our Christmas tradition ever since.</p>
            <p>I've been making her gifts for over thirty years now. Eventually, my mom got in on the action and I started making for both of them. These are not great works of art. But every now and then, one turns out pretty nice.</p>
            <p>Christmas 2023 was one of those years.</p>

            <p>After racking my brain for a small-ish wildlife print that would suit the holiday theme, this fine, antlered fellow came to life.</p>
            <p>He's carved in unmounted linoleum, inked with Supergraphic Black, and pressed on my <a href="https://woodzillapress.com/product-category/a3-lino-press/">Woodzilla A3</a>.</p>
            <p>The best part is, he fits right in with Christmas decor, but doesn't seem out of place the rest of the year.</p>
            <p>And, for once, I didn't make a bird.</p>
