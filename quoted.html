            <p>In the summer of 2021, I was looking for inspiration.</p>
            <p>I was going through one of those periods where, in true human fashion, I just wasn't sure what I should be doing with my life. What <em>was</em> my purpose, exactly? Was I squandering my precious little time here doing the wrong thing?</p>
            <p>Should I quit my job and draw birds for a living?</p>
            <p>After thinking about how to put my existential crisis to good use, I landed on the idea of looking up encouraging quotes and turning the best ones into illustrations. Yes. This was a good idea. I'd find inspiration <em>and</em> make stuff at the same time.</p>
            <p>I Googled my way to <a href="https://brainyquote.com">brainyquote.com</a> and dug in.</p>

            <p>The only time I could consistenly find in my schedule was my lunch breaks, so each of these was done in roughly an hour. A few took a little longer, but my goal was <a href="https://youtu.be/lRtV-ugIT0k?si=flBmPpAzGvnhg-4s">finished, not perfect</a>.</p>
            <p>For about a month, I cranked out one illustrated quote in <a href="https://procreate.com">Procreate</a> every day. (There are forty-four in total, but I only included a few here because you get the idea.)</p>
            <p>I read hundreds of quotes that month. I found the inspriation and encouragement I was looking for. And I enjoyed the hell out of scribbling on my iPad for a few minutes each day. I even created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quoted.blog/">Instagram account</a> for the project, foolishly thinking I'd keep making these things for, like, ever?</p>
            <p>My existential crisis eventually passed. That one, anyway.</p>
            <p>Whether reading those quotes&mdash;or drawing them&mdash;helped me come to peace with my life choices, I'm not sure. But looking back, I am sure that navigating an existential crisis by making stuff was a pretty good idea.</p>
